/*
Comprehensive 'Positive, Negative, Or Zero' Assessment In Java

Write a method called checkNumber with an int parameter named number.
The method should not return any value, and it needs to print out:

    - "positive" if the parameter number is > 0

    - "negative" if the parameter number is < 0

    - "zero" if the parameter number is equal to 0 

NOTE:  The checkNumber method needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE:  Do not add a main method to your solution code!

*/

public class PositiveNegativeZero {
    // write code here
    public static void checkNumber(int number) {
        System.out.println(number >= 0 ? (number == 0 ? "zero" : "positive") : "negative");
    }
}
